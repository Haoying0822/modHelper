## modHelper -- A Telegram Bot for students in NUS

**Motivation**

We are students from nus SoC and FoS.

In every semester, students in NUS take numerous modules with project requirements which require finding a telegram group chat and locating groupmates and study buddies. This task gets tedious when you are introverted or taking a module alone. 

Currently many choose to post in online forums to look for module chats, groupmates or study buddies. Yet as too many similar posts clout the forum, it becomes troublesome for students to find the exact match of their need for their respective modules, having to scroll through pages of posts. Direct messaging many other users is also a challenging task for many introverted students, not to mention that the outcomes of DMs are not so satisfactory most of the time. 

Locating fellow students in the same module and finding project group mates or study buddies will always be a need for NUS students due to the nature of our courses. So why isn't there an autobot to facilitate these matches so we donâ€™t have to waste our time looking for project mates?  

**User Stories**

- As a student who just started taking a module, I want to gain quick access to this module's general information, especially its workload distribution.
- As a student who wants to find classmates of a module, I want to be able to get a telegram group link of the respective module.
- As a student who wants to find groupmates of a module, I want to be able to match with others with the same need without having to manually search by myself.
- As a student who wants to find a study buddy, I want to be able to match with others based on faculty.

**Features -- A Telegram Bot**

Search Module Info

Send the module code and receive the module's information, including description, preclusion and workload generated from NUSMods.

Find Module Group

Receive the link to TeleNUS, where you can find all NUS-related Telegram groups.

Find Module Mate & Find Study Buddy

Send us the module code or select the faculty that you wish to find a module mate or study buddy. We will immediately start searching for a module mate for you. This process may need some time as other users are still on the way!
We will send a message you once the matching is done and from now on you can chat with your module mate anonymously in our bot. Once both users agree to match with each other, the bot will exchange the username for you and chat in the bot will be ended.
You can always opt to stop searching or exit from the chat:)
