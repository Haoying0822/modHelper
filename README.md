## A Reddit Bot for subreddit r/nus

**Motivation**

We are students from nus SoC and FoS.

In every semester, students in NUS take numerous modules with project requirements which require finding a telegram group chat and locating groupmates and study buddies. This task gets tedious when you are introverted or taking a module alone. 

Currently many choose to post in the reddit forum r/NUS to look for module chats, groupmates or study buddies. Yet as too many similar posts clout the forum, it becomes troublesome for students to find the exact match of their need for their respective modules, having to scroll through pages of posts and direct messaging many users.

Locating fellow students in the same module and finding project group mates or study buddies will always be a need for NUS students due to the nature of our courses. So why isn’t there an autobot to help students with this task so we don’t have to waste time roaming through Reddit?
